# Course Learning Outcomes  

## 1. What are the kinds of problems we see in nature?  
Nature provides numerous examples of problem-solving approaches:  

- **Iteration:** Tides rise and fall in a regular, repeated pattern.  
- **Recursion:** A cauliflower looks identical at every level, from stem to tip.  
- **Backtracking:** Solving a maze by retracing steps when hitting a dead end.  

These natural patterns inspire solutions to similar problems in algorithm design.

## 2. What is space and time efficiency? Why are they important?  

- **Time efficiency:** Measures how fast an algorithm performs.  
- **Space efficiency:** Measures how much additional memory it requires.  

If an algorithm is slow or consumes excessive memory, it becomes impractical for large-scale problems.  

### Types of Growth in Algorithms:  

- **Constant time (O(1)):** Performance remains the same regardless of input size.  
- **Logarithmic time (O(log n)):** Slows slightly as input grows.  
- **Linear time (O(n)):** Performance slows proportionally with input size.  
- **Linearithmic time (O(n log n)):** Slower than linear, but manageable.  
- **Quadratic time (O(n¬≤)):** Becomes significantly slower with larger inputs.  
- **Cubic time (O(n¬≥)):** Even slower than quadratic.  
- **Exponential (O(2‚Åø)) and Factorial (O(n!)):** Infeasible for large inputs.

## 3. What are the takeaways from different design principles?  
Effective problem-solving relies on various design principles:  

- **Divide and Conquer:** Break a problem into smaller parts, solve them individually, and combine results.  
- **Dynamic Programming:** Store solutions to subproblems to avoid redundant calculations.  
- **Greedy Algorithms:** Choose the optimal solution at each step.  
- **Backtracking:** Explore all possibilities and revert incorrect decisions.  

These principles improve algorithm performance and simplify complex problems.

## 4. How do tree data structures solve problems?  
Trees provide an organized way to store hierarchical data:  

- **Binary Search Tree (BST):** Efficient for searching sorted data but may become unbalanced.  
- **AVL Tree:** A self-balancing BST for optimal performance.  
- **2-3 Tree:** Handles dynamic data effectively.  
- **Red-Black Tree:** A balanced tree with fewer rebalancing operations.  
- **Heap:** Quickly finds the largest or smallest value.  
- **Trie:** Ideal for searching words or prefixes.

## 5. Why do we need array query algorithms?  
Array query algorithms enhance efficiency in answering range-based questions (e.g., finding the sum or maximum).  

### Examples:  
- **Prefix Sums:** Quickly calculate sums over any range.  
- **Segment Trees and Fenwick Trees:** Enable fast updates and queries.  

Applications include gaming, financial systems, and databases.

## 6. What is the difference between trees and graphs?  
### Trees:  
- **Structure:** A strict hierarchy with no loops (e.g., family trees).  
- **Traversals:** Preorder, Inorder, and Postorder for hierarchical analysis.  
- **Applications:** File organization, decision-making systems.  

### Graphs:  
- **Structure:** A collection of nodes and edges, allowing loops (e.g., road maps).  
- **Traversals:** Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS) for exploring networks.  
- **Applications:** Social networks, routing, and navigation systems.

## 7. What about sorting and searching algorithms?  

### Sorting Algorithms:  
- **Simple Algorithms:** Bubble Sort works well for small datasets.  
- **Efficient Algorithms:** Quick Sort and Merge Sort are suitable for large datasets.  

### Searching Algorithms:  
- **Linear Search:** Scans each element, slower but works with unsorted data.  
- **Binary Search:** Operates on sorted data for faster performance.  

### Real-life Applications:  
- Sorting algorithms rank search results or organize data.  
- Searching algorithms locate contacts or find optimal paths in maps.
