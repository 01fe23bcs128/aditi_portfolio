## CHITRANAGARI : SMART CITY DESIGN 

### Business Cases identified by Aditi Choudhary (01FE23BCS128)

**1. Industrial Expansion üè≠**  
As Chitranagari grows, it aims to establish itself as a hub for industrial development. The business case for industrial expansion involves the creation of dedicated industrial zones to boost economic growth and job opportunities. These zones will include small-scale, medium-scale, and large-scale industries with adequate infrastructure, such as efficient road networks, power supply, and waste management systems. The motive is twofold: 1. Attract investments from domestic and international companies, and 2. Utilize the revenue generated for further development of the city. Sustainable practices, such as green manufacturing units and carbon-neutral goals, will be incorporated to ensure environmental responsibility.

**2. Healthcare Infrastructure üè•**  
A smart city must prioritize the well-being of its citizens. This business case focuses on building a robust healthcare ecosystem, including multi-specialty hospitals, community health centers, and digital health facilities for remote consultations. With advanced healthcare systems integrated with AI and IoT, Chitranagari aims to provide efficient and accessible services to its citizens. Preventive healthcare initiatives, like fitness zones, parks, and awareness programs, will also be introduced. Additionally, the plan includes public health monitoring systems and a centralized emergency response mechanism to enhance healthcare delivery.

**3. Education Hub üéì**  
Chitranagari envisions becoming an educational powerhouse by establishing a network of schools, colleges, and research institutions. This business case focuses on creating a smart education system integrated with cutting-edge technology, including e-learning platforms, virtual labs, and interactive classrooms. Special emphasis will be placed on skill development and vocational training centers to prepare students for future industries. Partnerships with global universities and organizations will be encouraged to foster innovation and knowledge exchange. Scholarships and affordable education programs will be introduced to ensure inclusivity and accessibility for all citizens.

### Course learning outcomes
# 1. What are the kinds of problems we see in nature?
Nature shows many examples of problem-solving:

Iteration: Tides rise and fall in a regular, repeated pattern.
Recursion: A cauliflower looks the same at every level, from stem to tip.
Backtracking: Solving a maze by going back when you hit a dead end.
These ideas help us solve similar problems in algorithms.

# 2. What is space and time efficiency? Why are they important?
Time efficiency: How fast an algorithm works.
Space efficiency: How much extra memory it needs.
If an algorithm is too slow or uses too much memory, it won‚Äôt work well for large problems.

Types of growth in algorithms:

Constant time (O(1)): Always the same speed.
Logarithmic time (O(log n)): Gets slower, but not by much.
Linear time (O(n)): Slows down as input gets bigger.
Linearithmic time (O(n log n)): Slower than linear, but not too bad.
Quadratic time (O(n¬≤)): Much slower as input grows.
Cubic time (O(n¬≥)): Slower than quadratic.
Exponential (O(2‚Åø)) and Factorial time (O(n!)): Extremely slow for large inputs.

# 3. What are the takeaways from different design principles?
Key ideas to solve problems:

Divide and conquer: Break a problem into smaller pieces, solve them, and combine the results.
Dynamic programming: Save answers to smaller problems so you don‚Äôt repeat work.
Greedy algorithms: Always choose the best option at each step.
Backtracking: Test all possibilities and undo bad choices.
These ideas make algorithms faster and easier to understand.

# 4. How do tree data structures solve problems?
Trees are used to organize data in a hierarchy:

Binary Search Tree (BST): Good for searching sorted data but can become unbalanced.
AVL Tree: A balanced BST that works efficiently.
2-3 Tree: Easier to use for changing data.
Red-Black Tree: A balanced tree with fewer changes needed.
Heap: Used to find the largest or smallest value quickly.
Trie: Used to search words based on their prefixes.

# 5. Why do we need array query algorithms?
Array query algorithms make it faster to answer questions about an array, like finding the sum or maximum in a range.

Examples:

Prefix sums: Quickly calculate sums over any range.
Segment trees and Fenwick trees: Update and query data fast.
These are useful in games, stock markets, and databases.

# 6. What is the difference between trees and graphs?
Tree: A strict hierarchy with no loops (like a family tree).
Graph: A collection of connected nodes that can form loops (like a map of roads).
Traversals:

Trees: Preorder, Inorder, Postorder (for hierarchical data).
Graphs: DFS and BFS (for exploring networks or maps).
Uses:

Trees are used for organizing files and decision-making.
Graphs are used in social networks and routing systems.
# 7. What about sorting and searching algorithms?
Sorting: Organizes data:

Simple ones (Bubble Sort) are for small data.
Fast ones (Quick Sort, Merge Sort) work for big data.
Searching: Finds data:

Linear Search: Check each item, slower.
Binary Search: Look in sorted data, faster.
Real-life examples: Sorting helps rank search results, and searching is used in maps or finding¬†contacts.
